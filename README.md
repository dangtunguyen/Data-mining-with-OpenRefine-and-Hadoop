# Data mining with OpenRefine and Hadoop

This is a project of the class "*CS235 Data Mining Techniques*".

# Project Description
You are thinking about starting research in data mining and related fields. Your friend who is
already working on these fields has told you that conferences usually happen in nice and exotic
locations and even though this should not affect your decision, knowing that you will get to travel
to an exotic location to present your work is always some extra motivation. In this assignment
you are going to (empirically) verify your friendâ€™s statement by mining WikiCFP
http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/ a website that contains calls for papers for a wide variety of
conferences for multiple fields. You will have to 1) crawl the data, 2) clean the data, and 3) use
Hadoop to compute various statistics of the data.
